A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play. <｜Assistant｜><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a stone game, and I need to figure out for how many positive integers n ≤ 2024, Bob has a winning strategy. Hmm, okay, let me read the problem again.\n\nAlright, the problem is about a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first. The player who takes the last token wins. I need to find the number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win.\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to figure out for which n, Bob can always win. So Bob needs a winning strategy, meaning that whatever move he makes, Alice is forced into a losing position, or something like that. Wait, actually, in combinatorial game theory, positions can be either losing or winning. A position is a winning position if the current player can force a win, and a losing position if the current player cannot avoid losing.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, since Alice goes first, we need to find all n where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning that Bob can always win no matter what Alice does.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the losing positions in this game, which is a variant of the classic Nim game or something similar.\n\nWait, in such impartial games, positions can be classified as either losing or winning. A position is a losing position if the previous player cannot force a win, meaning the next player cannot force a win either.\n\nAlternatively, in this game, the losing positions are positions where no matter what move you make, the opponent can always respond in a way to force a win. So, the losing positions are those where the current player cannot avoid losing.\n\nWait, actually, in this case, since Alice goes first, we are to find the starting positions n where Bob can always win. So these are the losing positions for the starting player, which in this case is Alice. So, in standard impartial games, a losing position is one where the previous player cannot force a win.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a variant of the Nim game where the options are taking 1 or 4 tokens. So, in standard Nim, the losing positions are often positions where the number of tokens is a multiple of 5 (since 1 and 4 are the allowed moves, so mex function would be used, but maybe not exactly, but in this case, since the moves are only 1 and 4, perhaps the losing positions follow a certain modulo pattern.\n\nWait, for the game where you can remove 1 or 4 tokens, the losing positions are the numbers that are 1 mod 5, because any move you make will take you away from the multiple of 5.\n\nWait, wait, let me think. Let me think of the game as a subtraction game with subtraction of 1 or 4. The losing positions are those where the number of tokens is a multiple of 5 because from any multiple of 5, any move (subtract 1 or 4) would leave the opponent in a position that is not a multiple of 5, but perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are positions where n ≡ 0 mod 5.\n\nWait, in the standard game of Nim with move sizes of 1 and 4, the losing positions are indeed multiples of 5. Because if n is a multiple of 5, any move will take 1 or 4 tokens, leaving n-1 or n-4. Since 5 is 0 mod 5, then 5-1=4, which is 4, and 5-4=1. But 4 mod 5 is 4, which is not 0, so the next player can force the next position to be a multiple of 5.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, in this game, the losing positions are when the number of tokens is a multiple of 5. Because if you're faced with a multiple of 5, any move you make will leave the opponent in a position that's not a multiple of 5, and from there, they can always move to a multiple of 5.\n\nWait, no, actually, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.\n\nLet me try small n:\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, leaves 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins.\n\nWait, wait, that's not right. Let's take small values:\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, leaves 1. Then Bob takes the last one and wins.\n\nn=3: Alice takes 1, leaves 2. Then Bob takes 1, leaves 0, Bob wins.\n\nn=4: Alice takes 4, wins.\n\nn=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 for Bob, but then Bob can take 1, leaving 3, which would make Alice take 1, leaving 1, Bob takes it. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, leaving 1, Bob takes 1 and wins.\n\nWait, so for n=5, Alice cannot force a win, because whatever she does, Bob can win. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, n=5.\n\nIf Alice takes 1, leaving 4. Then Bob can take 4, winning immediately.\n\nIf Alice takes 4, leaving 1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins.\n\nSo n=5 is a losing position for Alice because she can't make a move that forces Bob into a losing position.\n\nWait, but wait, that suggests that n=5 is a losing position, meaning Bob can win if Alice is at n=5. So, n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.\n\nWait, let me check for n=6.\n\nn=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5. Then Bob takes 4, leaving 1, which is a winning move. Wait, wait, no, if n=6, Alice can take 1, leaving 5. Then Bob can take 4, but wait, 5 is not a multiple of 5, so if Bob takes 4, he can't make a move that leaves a multiple of 5. Wait, no, maybe my initial thought was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's test n=5: if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4, Bob wins. If Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1, Bob wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nn=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9. Then Bob can take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. Wait, but Bob can then win. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to look for a pattern.\n\nLet me list out small n and see who would win.\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1, etc.—wait, no, wait, n=2: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1, and Bob wins.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I should construct a table.\n\nLet me try to list the winning and losing positions for small n.\n\nn : Winner (B or A)\n1: Alice takes 1, wins.\n2: Alice takes 1, leaves 1, Bob takes it and wins.\n3: Alice takes 1, leaves 2, Bob takes 1, leaves 1, Alice takes 1, wins.\nWait, no, wait, no. Wait, n=3:\n\nWait, n=3:\n\n- Alice takes 1, leaves 2. Bob can take 1, leaves 1, Alice takes 1 and wins.\n\nWait, so Alice can win at n=3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this problem as a misère game, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a variant of the standard subtraction game where the last to move wins.\n\nIn the standard game, the losing positions are positions where n ≡ 0 mod 5, because from any multiple of 5, any move (subtract 1 or 4) leads to a position not a multiple of 5, so the next player can win.\n\nWait, let me test:\n\nn=5: Alice's options: take 1 (leaves 4) or 4 (leaves 1). If Alice takes 1, Bob can take 4 and win. If Alice takes 4, Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nn=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Bob. So Alice can win.\n\nWait, but no, wait. If Alice takes 1, Bob is left with 5, which is a losing position, so Bob can't win, so Alice can win.\n\nWait, but let's see n=6:\n\n- Alice can take 1, leaving 5. Bob is faced with 5. Bob can take 4, leaving 1, which Alice can take and win. So maybe I'm getting it wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are n=0,5,10,15,... and so on.\n\nWait, let's try n=6.\n\nIf n=6:\n\n- Alice can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Bob. So Bob is in a losing position, so Bob cannot win. Therefore, Alice can win.\n\nWait, so maybe positions where n ≡ 0 mod 5 are losing for Alice.\n\nWait, but n=5 is a losing position for Alice because whatever she does, Bob can win.\n\nWait, no, in n=5, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4 and wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice. Similarly, n=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9. Bob can take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice, so Bob wins. So n=10 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nSimilarly, n=15: Alice can take 1, leaving 14. Bob can take 4, leaving 10, which is a losing position for Alice. Bob can then win.\n\nWait, but what about n=6?\n\nIf n=6, Alice takes 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Bob. So Bob can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Alice, but wait, that would mean Bob cannot win. Wait, maybe n=6 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nWait, but then n=5 is a losing position.\n\nWait, let's test it step by step.\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1, Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nWait, wait, no, that can't be right because for n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1, Bob takes it and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, so perhaps the losing positions are n ≡ 0 mod 5.\n\nLet me test n=5:\n\n- Alice can take 1, leaving 4. Bob can take 4 and win.\n\nn=5: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4, wins.\n\nn=6:\n\n- Alice takes 1, leaving 5. Bob can take 4, leaving 1. Alice takes 1 and wins.\n\nn=10:\n\n- Alice takes 1, leaving 9. Bob takes 4, leaving 5. Alice takes 1, leaving 4. Bob takes 4 and wins.\n\nWait, but that would mean that n=10 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. But wait, in this scenario, Alice can force Bob into a losing position, so n=10 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nWait, but when n=5, Alice cannot force Bob into a losing position, so n=5 is a losing position.\n\nSo, it seems that the losing positions are n ≡ 0 mod 5. That is, when n is a multiple of 5, Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can win.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the initial thought because in n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4, and Bob takes 4 and wins.\n\nWait, that suggests that perhaps the losing positions are when n ≡ 0 mod 5.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, but Bob can then win.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn the game, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if a player is faced with n=1, they win.\n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1, Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nWait, maybe the losing positions are n=1,6,11,16,... So n ≡1 mod 5.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nn=6: Alice takes 1, leaving 5. Bob takes 4, leaving 1. Alice takes 1 and wins. So n=6: Alice can win.\n\nn=11: Alice takes 1, leaving 10. Bob takes 4, leaving 6. Alice takes 1, leaving 5. Bob takes 4, leaving 1. Alice takes 1 and wins.\n\nWait, this suggests that for n ≡1 mod 5, the player can always win. Hmm, but that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better approach. Maybe I should think of this in terms of Grundy numbers or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a variant of the standard subtraction game where the allowed moves are subtract 1 or subtract 4. The losing positions are those where n is congruent to 0 mod 5, because from any multiple of 5, any move will leave a position not a multiple of 5, so the next player can win.\n\nWait, so if n is a multiple of 5, Alice cannot win, so Bob can win. So, the losing positions are when n ≡0 mod 5.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that when n is 5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Bob, but in reality, maybe I was wrong.\n\nWait, let's take n=5:\n\n- Alice takes 1, leaving 4. Bob takes 4 and wins. So n=5 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nWait, maybe the initial assumption was wrong, and the losing positions are when n is not a multiple of 5, and the winning positions are when n is a multiple of 5.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the losing positions are n ≡ 1 mod 5.\n\nWait, I think I need to find a better approach. Let me think of the possible moves:\n\nEach player can take 1 or 4 tokens. So, the losing positions are those n where any move leads to a position that is a winning position for the opponent.\n\nSo, if I can define P-positions (previous player can force a win) and N-positions (next player can force a win).\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this recursively. Let's define a position n as a P-position if the previous player can force a win, and N-position otherwise.\n\nBase case: n=0 is a losing position, as it's a win for the player who just moved.\n\nWait, but n starts at 1, so let's build up from n=0.\n\nn=0: losing (base case).\n\nn=1: can take 1 and win. So n=1 is a winning position.\n\nn=2: can take 1, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the next player. Wait, wait, no: if n=2, Alice can take 1, leaving 1, and Bob can take 1 and win. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice, as she can force a win.\n\nWait, maybe the losing positions are those where n ≡ 0 mod 5. So, for n=5,10,15, etc., Alice cannot make a move that leads Bob into a losing position, so n=5 is a losing position.\n\nWait, but when n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4, which is 4. If n=4, it's a winning position for Bob, as he can take 4 and win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice because she can't force a win.\n\nSimilarly, n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Bob. So n=6 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nn=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9. Bob can take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. So n=10 is a losing position for Alice.\n\nWait, so the losing positions are multiples of 5, and winning positions otherwise.\n\nSo, if n is a multiple of 5, Alice cannot win, so Bob can win. If n is not a multiple of 5, Alice can win.\n\nWait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Wait, because when n is a multiple of 5, any move Alice makes (take 1 or 4) will leave a non-multiple of 5, which is a winning position for Bob.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nn=5: Alice takes 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Bob, who can take 4 and win.\n\nn=6: Alice takes 1, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Bob, so Bob can't win. So n=6 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nn=10: Alice takes 1, leaving 9. Bob can take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice. So n=10 is a losing position.\n\nn=11: Alice takes 1, leaving 10, which is a losing position for Bob. So n=11 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nSo, in general, the losing positions are n ≡ 0 mod 5. So for n ≡ 0 mod 5, Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can. So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 mod5 are the losing positions for Alice, meaning Bob can win.\n\nWait, but wait, in n=5, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4, and wins. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.\n\nSimilarly, n=10: Alice takes 1, Bob can take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.\n\nThus, in general, the numbers n where n ≡0 mod5 are losing positions for Alice, so Bob can win.\n\nSo, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 mod5 is equal to the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 2024.\n\nWait, but let's confirm with n=5,10,15,..., up to the maximum multiple of 5 ≤2024.\n\nThe largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2024 ÷5 is 404.8, so 404*5=2020. So, the multiples of 5 up to 2024 are 5,10,15,...,2020, which is 404 numbers.\n\nWait, but wait: 5×404 = 2020, so n=2020 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.\n\nThus, the number of such n is 404.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to find the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win, which are exactly the n ≡0 mod5. So the count is floor(2024/5) = 404.8, so 404.\n\nWait, but wait, n=5 is a losing position, so Bob can win, but when n=5, is that correct?\n\nWait, in n=5, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4 and wins. So yes, Bob can win.\n\nSimilarly, n=10, Alice takes 1, Bob takes 4, leaving 5, so Bob wins.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020. So how many terms are there?\n\nThe number of terms is floor(2024/5) = 404.8, which is 404 terms.\n\nWait, but let me check 5×404=2020, which is less than 2024. The next multiple would be 405×5=2025, which is beyond 2024.\n\nThus, the answer would be 404.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"positive integers n ≤ 2024\". So n can be 5,10,...,2020, which is 404 numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=5,10,15,...,2020, the count is indeed 404.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that n=5 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win, which matches. So the count is 404.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem statement says \"the last token wins.\" So, in the case where n=1, Alice takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nWait, so the losing positions are n ≡0 mod5, so Bob can win. Therefore, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can win is the number of n ≡0 mod5, which is 404.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4, which is a winning position for Bob. So Bob can take 4 and win, so n=5 is a losing position for Alice. Thus, n=5,10,15,...,2020 are the losing positions for Alice, so Bob can win.\n\nThus, the number of such n is 2024//5 = 404.8, so 404.\n\nWait, but wait, when n=5, the number is 5, which is 5×1, but 5×404=2020, which is less than 2024, and 5×405=2025>2024.\n\nSo the count is 404.\n\nWait, but wait, I need to confirm for n=2024. 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 404 multiples of 5. So 5×404=2020, which is less than 2024. So 2020 is included, and the next is 2025, which is beyond.\n\nHence, the number of such n is 404.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"the last token wins.\" So, for n=5, Alice takes 1, leaving 4, and Bob takes 4 and wins. So yes, Bob wins. Similarly, n=10, Bob can win.\n\nWait, so the answer is 404.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem says \"the last token wins,\" so if n is a multiple of 5, then Bob can win.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can win is 404.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check n=2024. 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is 404, since 5×404=2020, which is less than 2024.\n\nSo, the answer is 404.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought earlier that n=5 was a losing position, so Bob can win, but the problem says to find the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win. So, the answer is 404.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake here because when n is a multiple of 5, Alice cannot make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position. Wait, perhaps I need to correct my initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the losing positions are when n ≡1 mod5, and winning positions otherwise. Let me test.\n\nn=1: Alice takes 1, wins.\n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, leaves 1, Bob takes 1 and wins.\n\nWait, so n=2 is a winning position for Alice. So n=2 is not a losing position. So, if n is not a multiple of 5, Alice can win.\n\nWait, maybe the losing positions are n ≡1 mod5.\n\nLet me test n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins, so it's a winning position.\n\nn=2: Alice takes 1, leaves 1, Bob takes 1 and wins.\n\nn=3: Alice takes 1, leaves 2, Bob takes 1, leaves 1, Alice takes 1 and wins.\n\nWait, so n=3 is a winning position.\n\nn=4: Alice takes 1, leaves 3, Bob takes 1, leaves 2, Alice takes 1, leaves 1, Bob takes 1 and wins.\n\nn=5: Alice takes 1, leaves 4, Bob takes 4 and wins.\n\nn=6: Alice takes 1, leaves 5, which is a losing position for Bob. So, n=6 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nWait, this suggests that n=5 is a losing position, so Bob can win. But then, the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 mod5 is 404.\n\nWait, but in this case, the number of losing positions is 404. So, the answer would be 404.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier analysis, when n is a multiple of 5, Alice cannot win, so Bob can win.\n\nThus, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 404.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check n=5. Alice takes 1, leaves 4. Bob takes 4, wins. So Bob wins.\n\nn=10: Alice takes 1, leaves 9. Bob can take 4, leaves 5, which is a losing position for Alice. So Bob wins.\n\nSimilarly, n=15: Alice takes 1, leaves 14. Bob takes 4, leaves 10, which is a losing position for Alice. Bob wins.\n\nThus, in all these cases, Bob can win, meaning that the numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020. So 2020 is the largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024.\n\nThe count is 2020 /5 = 404. So, 404 numbers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 404.\n\nBut wait, wait, when n=5, 10, 15,...,2020, that's 404 terms. So, the number of such n is 404.\n\nHence, the final answer is 404.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{404}\n</think>\n\nAlice and Bob play a game with a stack of \\( n \\) tokens, where Alice goes first. The players take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice wins if she can take the last token.

This is because from any multiple of 5, any move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) leaves a position that is not a multiple of 5, which is a winning position for the opponent.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\): Alice takes 1, leaves 4. Bob takes 4 and wins.\n   - For \\( n = 10 \\): Alice takes 1, leaves 9. Bob takes 4, leaves 5, a losing position for Alice.\n   - This pattern holds for all multiples of 5, where Alice cannot force a win.\n\n4. **Counting Multiples of 5**:\n   - The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020.\n   - The number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 2024 \\) for which Bob can guarantee a win is \\(\\boxed{404}\\).", "response_length": 6661, "gold": "Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$, Alice will take $1$, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$, Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$, $3$, or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\n\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is $n$ is a multiple of $5$, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\n\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$. Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\n\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$.

Let me re-read the problem to make sure I have it right.\n\nWait, wait, hold on, wait, let me check the problem again to make sure I didn't misunderstand.\n\nWait, actually, I just need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers satisfying two conditions:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a = 6,000,000.\n\nWait, hold on, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, no, actually the problem statement says:\n\n\"Find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a = 6,000,000.\"\n\nWait, but 6,000,000 seems like a large number, maybe 6 million.\n\nWait, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's focus on the problem as stated, and perhaps I'll check the arithmetic later.\n\nWait, but before that, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Wait, the equation given is a + b + c = 300, and another condition involving a^2b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a big number. Hmm.\n\nWait, wait, 6 million is a big number, but maybe the problem is correctly presented.\n\nBut maybe I can approach this problem in a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe the equation a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a can be rewritten. Let me compute this expression.\n\nLet me see: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a.\n\nHmm, let me factor this expression.\n\nWait, let's factor terms:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a.\n\nWait, factor terms with a²: a²(b + c) + bc(a + b) + c²a.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps factor terms differently.\n\nWait, let me try grouping:\n\na²b + a²c = a²(b + c)\nSimilarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)\nAnd then +c²a.\n\nSo the entire expression is a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²a.\n\nBut wait, perhaps factor (a + b + c):\n\nWait, since a + b + c = 300, so a + b + c = 300.\n\nSo, (b + c) = 300 - a\nSimilarly, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.\n\nSo substituting:\n\na²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²a = a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).\n\nSo, let me compute this expression.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³\n\nb²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³\n\nc²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³\n\nAdding them up: 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³).\n\nBut from the first condition, a + b + c = 300. Hmm, maybe we can use the identity for a³ + b³ + c³.\n\nWait, perhaps using the identity that a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac). Hmm, but maybe that's complicating.\n\nWait, but wait, in our expression, we have - (a³ + b³ + c³) + 300(a² + b² + c²). Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to the identity.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe using symmetric sums.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300.\n\nWe can denote S1 = a + b + c = 300.\n\nSimilarly, denote S2 = ab + bc + ca.\n\nAnd S3 = abc.\n\nI can use the identity:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use that to relate the two equations.\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)^3.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, so (a + b + c)^3 = 300^3 = 2,700,000.\n\nBut from the expression, (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo, 300^3 = (a³ + b³ + c³) + 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWe have 300^3 = (a³ + b³ + c³) + 900*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nBut from our given expression, we have 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nWait, let me write the given equation as:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, from the expansion, I have:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut from the expansion, (a + b + c)^3 = 300^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 300^3 - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider using the equation we have:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me denote T = a² + b² + c² and U = a³ + b³ + c³.\n\nThen, the equation becomes 300*T - U = 6,000,000.\n\nBut I also know that T and U are related via the identity:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWhich is:\n\n300^3 = U + 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo,\n\n27,000,000 = U + 900*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nLet me denote V = ab + bc + ca, and W = abc.\n\nSo, 27,000,000 = U + 900V - 3W.\n\nBut from the previous equation, we have:\n\n300T - U = 6,000,000.\n\nBut T = a² + b² + c², and V = ab + bc + ca.\n\nSo, perhaps I can express U in terms of T and V.\n\nBut perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express U in terms of T and V.\n\nWait, the expression we have:\n\n300T - U = 6,000,000.\n\nBut also, we have:\n\n300T - U = 6,000,000.\n\nAnd we also have:\n\n300^3 = U + 900V - 3W.\n\nSo, let's substitute U from the first equation into the second.\n\nFrom first equation: U = 300T - 6,000,000.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n300^3 = (300T - 6,000,000) + 900V - 3W.\n\nBut 300^3 is 27,000,000, so:\n\n27,000,000 = 300T - 6,000,000 + 900V - 3W.\n\nSimplify:\n\n27,000,000 + 6,000,000 = 300T + 900V - 3W.\n\nSo, 33,000,000 = 300T + 900V - 3W.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe this approach is getting too tangled.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider if the given equation can be simplified more directly.\n\nWait, perhaps I can factor the given equation:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a.\n\nLet me factor this expression:\n\na²b + a²c = a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a).\n\nSimilarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c) = b²(300 - b).\n\nAnd c²a + c²b = c²(a + b) = c²(300 - c).\n\nSo the entire expression is:\n\na²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.\n\nWhich is 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's the same as before. Maybe I can think of it in terms of a, b, c being variables summing to 300.\n\nBut maybe I can consider substituting variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the identity:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca).\n\nBut given that a + b + c = 300, this becomes:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = 300(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca).\n\nSo, the expression in the problem is:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.\n\nBut from the identity, a³ + b³ + c³ = 300(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca) + 3abc.\n\nSubstituting into the problem's equation:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - [300(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - 300(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSimplify:\n\n300(a² + b² + c²) - 300(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n0 + 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's a simpler equation: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me factor out bc:\n\nWait, perhaps factor out 'c' from the terms:\n\n100bc + 100ab + 100ca - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nWait, perhaps factor c:\n\n100bc + 100ab + 100ca - abc = 100c(a + b) + 100ab - abc.\n\nWait, 100c(a + b) = 100c(300 - c) since a + b = 300 - c.\n\nSo, substitute:\n\n100c(300 - c) + 100ab - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me factor c from the first and third terms:\n\n100c(300 - c) + c(100b - ab) = 2,000,000.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure that's helpful. Maybe I should try to express a + b + c = 300, so perhaps I can find a relationship between a, b, and c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of a, b, c as variables that sum to 300, and the other equation involving their products.\n\nBut perhaps another approach: Let's think in terms of symmetric functions.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca,\n\nand P = abc.\n\nWe have another equation: 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nBut from the identity earlier, I know that:\n\na³ + b³ + c³ = 300^3 - 300Q + 3P.\n\nBut perhaps that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but in the previous step, we have 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, we can write P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSo, if I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of Q and P, perhaps.\n\nBut perhaps I can relate this with the equation we have.\n\nWait, but maybe another angle. Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps we can consider the possible values of a, b, c that satisfy both equations.\n\nBut since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that a, b, c are all equal, or in some other symmetric way.\n\nWait, let me test if a = b = c is a possibility. If a = b = c, then each is 100.\n\nSo, a = b = c = 100.\n\nThen, check the given equation:\n\na²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a = 3*(100²*100) = 3*(10,000*100) = 3*1,000,000 = 3,000,000.\n\nBut the problem's equation is 6,000,000, which is double that. So, a = b = c =100 is not a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe two variables are equal, and the third is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one of the variables is 0. Let's see.\n\nSuppose c = 0. Then, a + b = 300.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\na²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, 300ab = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.\n\nGiven a + b = 300.\n\nSo, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nThis is a system of equations:\n\na + b = 300\n\nab = 20,000\n\nWhich is a quadratic equation:\n\nx² - 300x + 20,000 = 0\n\nSolve: x = [300 ± sqrt(90000 - 80000)] / 2 = [300 ± sqrt(10000)] / 2 = [300 ± 100]/2.\n\nThus, x = 200 or x = 100.\n\nSo, a and b can be (200, 100) or (100, 200). Since a and b are non-negative integers, so there are two solutions when c = 0.\n\nBut wait, but the problem is to find the number of triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are non-negative integers. So, each of these cases would correspond to two ordered triples, but considering that a and b can be swapped, but since we're counting ordered triples, (a, b, c) is different from (b, a, c) if a ≠ b.\n\nWait, no, wait: in the case when c=0, we have two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0), but considering that a, b, c can be in any order, but since c=0, the other two can be arranged in any order. Wait, but in this case, (200,100,0) and (100,200,0) are distinct, but in terms of ordered triples, each is unique, but since c is fixed at 0, but a and b can be in any order.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're to count ordered triples, so each permutation of a, b, c where c=0 is a different triple. So, for c=0, we have two ordered triples: (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 100, 200), (0, 200, 100), (200, 0, 100). Wait, but that would be six ordered triples. Wait, no, because if c=0, then a and b can be 200 and 100 in any order, so for each choice of a and b, we have two possibilities, but since c is fixed at 0, so the number of ordered triples where c=0 is 2 (since a and b can be (200,100,0) and (100,200,0)).\n\nWait, but actually, in this case, a and b are distinct, so each permutation would be a different triple. So, for c=0, there are two possibilities for a and b, each giving two ordered triples (since a and b can be swapped), so 2 ordered triples.\n\nWait, but when c=0, a and b can be (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly, if a=100, b=200, c=0, and a=0, b=200, c=100, etc. So, actually, each pair (200,100,0) and its permutations give 3! / (1!1!1!) = 6 permutations, but since two of them are with c=0, perhaps.\n\nWait, no, because in this case, a + b = 300, and a and b are 200 and 100, which are distinct. So, for each of the two ordered pairs (200,100,0) and (100,200,0), each gives 3! = 6 permutations, but since c is fixed at 0, but actually, a and b can be in any order, so 2 possibilities for a and b, each can be arranged in 2 ways (since a and b are distinct). So, 2 * 2 = 4 ordered triples where c=0.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem is about ordered triples, so each permutation counts as a separate solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nIf a + b = 300, and ab = 20,000, then the solutions are (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). So, for these two cases, we have two ordered triples where c=0.\n\nSimilarly, if c=0, and a and b can be arranged in 2 ways, so 2 ordered triples.\n\nNow, maybe I can also consider cases where c is not zero.\n\nWait, let's see: suppose c > 0.\n\nThen, from the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, which is 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nBut also, a + b + c = 300.\n\nI need to find non-negative integers a, b, c with a + b + c = 300 and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parameterize the variables. Let me set a = x, b = y, c = 300 - x - y.\n\nThen, the equation becomes 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSubstituting c = 300 - x - y.\n\nBut this might get messy, but let's try.\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\n= xy + y(300 - x - y) + x(300 - x - y)\n= xy + 300y - xy - y² + 300x - x² - xy\nWait, wait, let me compute term by term:\n\nab = x*y\n\nbc = y*(300 - x - y)\n\nca = x*(300 - x - y)\n\nSo, ab + bc + ca = xy + y*(300 - x - y) + x*(300 - x - y)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n= xy + 300y - xy - y² + 300x - x² - xy.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me compute each term again:\n\nab = xy.\n\nbc = y*(300 - x - y) = 300y - xy - y².\n\nca = x*(300 - x - y) = 300x - x² - xy.\n\nAdding these together:\n\nxy + (300y - xy - y²) + (300x - x² - xy) =\n\nxy + 300y - xy - y² + 300x - x² - xy\n\nSimplify:\n\nxy - xy - xy = -xy\n\n300y + 300x\n\n- y² - x²\n\nSo, ab + bc + ca = -xy + 300x + 300y - x² - y².\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n100*(-xy + 300x + 300y - x² - y²) - x y (300 - x - y) = 2,000,000.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, 100*(-xy + 300x + 300y - x² - y²) - x y (300 - x - y) = 2,000,000.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can factor it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor terms:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n-100x² - 100y² - 100xy + 30,000x + 30,000y - 100xy - 100x²y - 100xy² = 2,000,000.\n\nWait, this seems too messy. Maybe I'm making a mistake in expansion.\n\nWait, let me compute 100*(ab + bc + ca) first:\n\n= 100*(-xy + 300x + 300y - x² - y²).\n\nThen, subtract abc, which is x y (300 - x - y).\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n100*(-xy + 300x + 300y - x² - y²) - x y (300 - x - y) = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me expand the first part:\n\n= 100*(-xy) + 100*300x + 100*300y - 100x² - 100y² - x y (300 - x - y).\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n= -100xy + 30,000x + 30,000y - 100x² - 100y² - 300xy + x²y + xy².\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-100xy - 300xy = -400xy\n\n30,000x + 30,000y = 30,000(x + y)\n\n-100x² - 100y² = -100(x² + y²)\n\n+ x²y + xy².\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-400xy + 30,000x + 30,000y - 100x² - 100y² + x²y + xy² = 2,000,000.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try to think of the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000, where Q = ab + bc + ca and P = abc.\n\nWe have Q = (a + b + c)^2 - (a² + b² + c²)/2? Wait, no, that's not a standard identity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of Q and P in terms of symmetric sums.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to consider that a, b, c are all positive integers. Since the problem is symmetric, perhaps a, b, c are all multiples of some number, say d, so that a = d * x, b = d * y, c = d * z, where x + y + z = 300/d and the other equation is satisfied.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that would help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that one of the variables is zero, but that only gives the case when two variables are 200 and 100, but that's just one case.\n\nWait, perhaps consider that a, b, c are all equal. If a = b = c, then a = b = c = 100, but as we saw earlier, that gives the equation 3,000,000, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps two variables are equal, say a = b, then c = 300 - 2a.\n\nLet me assume a = b, then c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\na²a + a²c + a²c + a²c + c²a + c²a = 6,000,000.\n\nWait, no, wait: the expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a.\n\nIf a = b, then:\n\na²a + a²c + a²c + a²c + c²a = a³ + 3a²c + c²a.\n\nSo, total expression: a³ + 3a²c + c²a = 6,000,000.\n\nWith c = 300 - 2a.\n\nSo, substituting c = 300 - 2a:\n\na³ + 3a²(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 * a = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na³ + 3a²*(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 * a.\n\nCompute each part:\n\n1. a³.\n\n2. 3a²*(300 - 2a) = 900a² - 6a³.\n\n3. (300 - 2a)^2 * a = (90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²) * a = 90,000a - 1,200a² + 4a³.\n\nNow, sum all terms:\n\na³ + (900a² - 6a³) + (90,000a - 1,200a² + 4a³).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na³ -6a³ +4a³ = (-6 +4)a³ = -2a³.\n\n900a² - 1200a² = -300a².\n\n90,000a remains.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n-2a³ - 300a² + 90,000a = 6,000,000.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n2a³ + 300a² - 90,000a = -6,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2a³ + 300a² - 90,000a + 6,000,000 = 0.\n\nDivide equation by 2:\n\na³ + 150a² - 45,000a + 3,000,000 = 0.\n\nLooking for integer solutions for a.\n\nLet me try small integer values.\n\na=100: 100^3 + 150*100^2 - 45,000*100 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 1,000,000 + 15,000*100 - 4,500,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 1,000,000 + 1,500,000 - 4,500,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= (1,000,000 + 1,500,000) + (-4,500,000 + 3,000,000).\n\n= 2,500,000 - 1,500,000 = 1,000,000 ≠ 0.\n\na=150: 150^3 + 150*(150)^2 -45,000*150 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 3,375,000 + 150*22,500 - 6,750,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 3,375,000 + 3,375,000 - 6,750,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= (3,375,000 + 3,375,000) + (-6,750,000 + 3,000,000).\n\n= 6,750,000 - 3,750,000 = 3,000,000 ≠ 0.\n\na=200: 8,000,000 + 150*40,000 -45,000*200 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 8,000,000 + 6,000,000 -9,000,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= (8,000,000 + 6,000,000) + (-9,000,000 + 3,000,000).\n\n= 14,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 8,000,000 ≠ 0.\n\na=120: 120^3 + 150*(120)^2 -45,000*120 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 1,728,000 + 150*14,400 - 5,400,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 1,728,000 + 2,160,000 -5,400,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= (1,728,000 + 2,160,000) + (-5,400,000 + 3,000,000).\n\n= 3,888,000 - 2,400,000 = 1,488,000 ≠ 0.\n\nHmm, maybe a=60:\n\n60^3 + 150*(60)^2 -45,000*60 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 216,000 + 150*3,600 - 2,700,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= 216,000 + 540,000 - 2,700,000 + 3,000,000.\n\n= (216,000 + 540,000) + (-2,700,000 + 3,000,000).\n\n= 756,000 + 300,000 = 1,056,000 ≠ 0.\n\nThis approach might not be working.
